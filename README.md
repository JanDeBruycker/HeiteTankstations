# HeiteTankstations
A webpage for my current workplace.

The src folder contains the website itself, 
the lib folder contains the transpiled javascript file.

The website is made in Dutch (or at least its content), since it's located in Belgium.
The site itself displays 4 sections:  - Home (the index)
                                      - Pomp (kinds of fuel we sell/methods of payment)
                                      - Shop (all articles we sell (not fuel) + a small preview of the shop itself)
                                      - Contact (contactinfo & a form to send complaints/problems regarding our store/pump)

Since I probably won't be making anymore changes to it and/or use it, I could as well share to see where/how I can improve.
